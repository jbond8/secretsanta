# GooglyBooglyz Secret Santa 2022
There is a BASH script that has an R script inside it. 

The BASH script will run the R script, which will match gift givers and recipients, ensure that they are not the same, ensure that they did not get the same people as last year, and then create the .txt files of who gets who.

The BASH script will then create nine random 4-digit passcodes between 1000 and 9999 and assign them to a zipped version of each.txt file.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I could not automate the process further to have them uploaded to Google Drive. There exists a gdrive package that I could've included in the BASH script. In addition, to prevent me from seeing the passcodes, I could've sent them automatically to other people as well using one of the many email, mail, or gmail packages that exist.

So I had to manually upload them to Google Drive and manually send passwords to everybody.
