# GooglyBooglyz Secret Santa 2022
There is a BASH script that has a R script inside it. 

The BASH script will run the R script, which will match Givers and Receivers of gifts, check that none of them are the same, check that none of them got the same people as last year, and then it will create the .txt files of who gets who. 

The BASH script will then create 9 random 4-digit passcodes between 1000 and 9999 and assign them to a zipped version of each .txt file.

Unfortunatly due to time constraints, I could not automate the process further to have them uploaded to Google Drive. There exists a gdrive package that I could've included in the BASH script. In addition, to prevent me from seeing the passcodes I could've sent them automatically to people as well using one of the many email, mail, gmail packages that exist.

So I had to manually upload them to Google Drive and manually send passwords to everybody.
