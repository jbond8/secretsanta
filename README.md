# GooglyBooglyz Secret Santa 2024

New and Improved. Nice and Clean.

Python for back-end and HTML/CSS for front-end.

The Python runs FastAPI and each function of the program is treated like an API call.

When the FastAPI is first launched, it will generate a random password for the Administrator. It will not be recorded or saved and is up to the Administrator to keep safe.

It is setup so a designated administator can make call the API to make a list of random givers and recipients and a list of passwords. The API function will ensure that givers and recipients are not the same, and then create the .txt files of who gets who in the list of random gives and recipients.

Additional functions can be performed by the Administrator to restore the Secret Santa giver/reciever and password lists in case FastAPI goes down.

~The End~

P.S. I dont wan't to explain everything lol
